## 🌟 **About the Project**

**Word Whiz** is a fun, interactive word-guessing game inspired by the classic “Hangman.”
Your mission? Guess the hidden word before you run out of lives! Each wrong guess sends a programming language into extinction — starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript... until only **Assembly** remains 😭

### 🕹️ Gameplay Flow:

1. A random word is selected from a large dictionary.
2. Players guess letters using an on-screen keyboard.
3. Each incorrect guess eliminates a “language” chip.
4. Lose all 8 languages? Game Over.
5. Guess all letters correctly? You win 🎉

It’s not just a word game — it’s a battle to **save the programming world**!
